# SBSPS-Challenge-1751-Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Food-Security-Visualization-Dashboard
Covid-19 has caused unprecedented disruption to pre-existing supply chains, but perhaps the most consequential chain affected is the food supply chain. All over the world, government measures and lifestyle changes have limited the supply of food and also caused problems in the logistics of food production. There are many ways in which these problems manifest themselves in the lives of various people, affecting every person differently. The lack of extensive recent data exacerbates this issue . In our project, we aim to work with both old and recent datasets to understand historic relationships and extrapolate them to simulate the current situation.

We particularly aim to use Machine Learning algorithms to understand the relationship between parameters that guide the food supply chains, and visualise these effects on a dashboard.
We perform analysis on two levels-
1. Price Elasticity- We understand how sensitive the demand is towards price changes, changes in quantity produced and other factors. This helps us understand how to reduce the supply demand gap for crops.
2. Churn Analysis- Similar to traditional analysis, where we aim to understand which groups of people are likely to reduce the purchase of grocery items, which can help us identify vulnerable clusters in the population.

Finally we will create a dashboard to visualise these results. This can help the stakeholders of our project- farmers and businesses, make decisions about their production and selling practices. Policy makers are also able to ensure that they implement policies that cater to vulnerable populations highlighted in our visualisation results.
